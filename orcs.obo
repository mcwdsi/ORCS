comment: It's compiling "software" (scare quotes) and not "source code" because you can compile Java bytecode to machine code, and Java bytecode is not technically "source code".  Compiling source code would be a subclass of this class (as would compiling Java bytecode, etc.).
comment: Source code can be automatically generated to some extent, but we're assuming humans still curate it minimally. Also, in the case of Java and its JVM, it's machine interpretable instructions, not directly executable. Ditto for other languages with intermediate form like Java byte code.

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)" xsd:string

If, for example, it is correct to conceive geological layers of the Earth as fiat object parts of the Earth, then even though these layers were first delineated in recent times, still existed long before such delineation and what holds of these layers (for example that the oldest layers are also the lowest layers) did not begin to hold because of our acts of delineation.Treatment of material entity in BFOExamples viewed by some as problematic cases for the trichotomy of fiat object part, object, and object aggregate include: a mussel on (and attached to) a rock, a slime mold, a pizza, a cloud, a galaxy, a railway train with engine and multiple carriages, a clonal stand of quaking aspen, a bacterial community (biofilm), a broken femur. Note that, as Aristotle already clearly recognized, such problematic cases – which lie at or near the penumbra of instances defined by the categories in question – need not invalidate these categories.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting." xsd:string

def: "An object which is large enough to be visible to humans, but small enough that humans can handle the object (i.e. transport it, examine it, etc) in its entirety with little to no technological assistance." []
comment: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mesoscopic
comment: This is a legacy class from ENVO's early versions. It will be depopulated and filled in by inference using a PATO quality. Not to be confused with "mesoscopic" as defined in physics, which deals with objects typically between 10e-6 and 10-8 meters in diameter.

def: "A system which has the disposition to environ one or more material entities." []
comment: In ENVO's alignment with the Basic Formal Ontology, this class is being considered as a subclass of a proposed BFO class "system". The relation "environed_by" is also under development. Roughly, a system which includes a material entity (at least partially) within its site and causally influences that entity may be considered to environ it. Following the completion of this alignment, this class' definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

def: "The internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of animals (individuals or groups) to internal or external stimuli, via a mechanism that involves nervous system activity." [GOC:ems, GOC:jl, ISBN:0395448956, PMID:20160973]
comment: 1. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation reviews.\n2. While a broader definition of behavior encompassing plants and single cell organisms would be justified on the basis of some usage (see PMID:20160973 for discussion), GO uses a tight definition that limits behavior to animals and to responses involving the nervous system, excluding plant responses that GO classifies under development, and responses of unicellular organisms that has general classifications for covering the responses of cells in multicellular organisms (e.g. cell chemotaxis).

name: biological_process
def: "A biological process represents a specific objective that the organism is genetically programmed to achieve. Biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a divided cell) from a single parent cell. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

Even knowledgeable and experienced scientists can benefit from computational tools that help navigate this vast and rapidly evolving terrain. In this paper, we describe a novel computational approach to this challenge, a knowledge-based system that combines reading, reasoning and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. Reading methods extract information from external resources, either by parsing structured data or biomedical language processing to extract information from unstructured data, and track knowledge provenance.  Reasoning methods enrich the knowledge that results from reading by, for example, noting two genes that are annotated to the same ontology term or database entry.  Reasoning is also used to combine all sources into a knowledge network that represents the integration of all sorts of relationships between a pair of genes, and to calculate a combined reliability score. Reporting methods combine the knowledge network with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualize the combined network in a tool that facilitates the knowledge-based analysis of that data." xsd:string

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3608171/):\n\n\nThe search for genetic risk factors for common human diseases often relies on the use of linkage and association studies to establish correlation between genomic markers and disease risk. These studies require additional functional evaluation of candidate genes, including their possible interaction with diet and environment. The number of candidate genes is typically large and the development of appropriate genetic tools in mammalian systems is slow. By contrast, large-scale genetic screens, using widely available genetic tools, are routinely conducted in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we used Drosophila to screen candidate genes identified in human genome-wide scans as associated with risk of metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes. We show that a number of human candidate genes have fly orthologs that play an important role in Drosophila tolerance to high dietary sucrose. We further explored some of the specific metabolic abnormalities that can result when these genes’ activities are reduced in flies, focusing on a gene we call dHHEX (CG7056), the fly ortholog of human HHEX." xsd:string

comment: Personal names "today usually comprises a given name bestowed at birth or at a young age plus a surname. It is nearly universal for a human to have a name; except in rare cases, for example feral children growing up in isolation, or infants orphaned by natural disaster for whom no written record survives.[citation needed] The Convention on the Rights of the Child specifies that a child has the right from birth to a name. Certain isolated tribes, such as the Machiguenga of the Amazon, also lack personal names." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name)
comment: Sep 29, 2016: The comment that including the wikipedia definition of personal name is not to be interpreted in a way that restricts this class to only contain strings of letters. A numerical or alphanumerical identifier that denotes a human is being is a personal name, too. (MB)

def: "A document that is a collection of identifiers that has been created to identify and annotate core ideas of a specified domain, and where the intention of its creators is that the identifiers have a one-to-one correspondence with entities in reality outside the aggregate." []
comment: Does not imply absence vs. presence of any taxonomy.
comment: Does not imply that identifiers denote particulars, universals, or defined classes (a.k.a. attributive collections) or even that they denote only one of these three types of entities (e.g., SNOMED and even various OBO ontologies have identifiers that identify entities in all three categories).
comment: Each identifier is often (but not necessarily) associated with a text string—variously called a “description,” “name,” “title,” or “label”—that helps humans reach the target of denotation.\n\nWhen there is no such string, it is almost always because the identifiers take the form of human language words. For example, a “sex” or “gender” code set could have identifiers “MALE” and “FEMALE,” or even “M” and “F” (by convention, we understand what these mean).
comment: For each given domain, there can potentially exist multiple code sets. The multiplicity of code sets is partially due to the different specific purposes of those code sets.
comment: For National Drug Codes (NDCs) and similar code sets, there doesn’t even have to be a single, fully-concretized copy somewhere (for example, for NDCs there is no centralized database or repository where they all live as one instance of concretization of code set). The code set can be “distributively” concretized. This seems like an unusual exception, but it also likely applies to Universal Product Codes (UPCs) and their follow on Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs).
comment: Many code sets are created for a specific purpose in addition to merely identifying and annotating core ideas of a specified domain.
comment: The identifiers do not denote each other.

comment: The phrase "in need of being perceived" does not imply that only planned processes that are in fact perceived can be social acts. Reinach clarifies that by exemplifying these matters for commands: "The command is according to its essence in need of being heard (vernehmungsbedürtig". It can of course happen that commands are given without being heard. Then they fail to fulfil their purpose. They are like thrown spears which fall to the ground without hitting their target." (A. Reinach: The Apriori Foundations of the Civil Law." Edited by J. Crosby, Heusenstamm: ontos Verlag, 2012).\nReinach clearly does not imply that a command that does not fulfill its prupose would not be a command.\nThanks to W.R. Hogan for finding the Reinach quote.

The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string

comment: We are aware of the fact that Wikipedia's definition differs from ours by saying that "Legal personality (...) is the characteristic of a non-living entity regarded by law to have the status of personhood" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality) \nHowever, Shaw explicates:\n"In any legal system, certain entities, whether they be individuals or companies, will be regarded as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. Thus an individual may prosecute or be prosecuted for assault and a company can sue for breach of contract. They are able to do this because the law recognises them as 'legal persons' possessing the capacity to have and to maintain certain rights, and being subject to perform specific duties. (...) In municipal law individuals, limited companies and public corporations are recognized as each possessing a distinct legal personality, the terms of which are circumscribed by the relevant legislation" (Shaw MN: International Law. Sixth Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008).                We hold that Shaw's position is ontological more prolific since it not only allows to explain how groups of individuals become recognized as unities at law, but also how different individuals can hold different legal personality roles (always against the context of one legal system). The latter will proof useful when dealing with the representing comatous patients or minorsat law in ontologies.

def: "A health care facility that bears a function to provide low intensity healthcare services to patients on a short-term basis, with patients leaving on the same date as arriving (i.e., without them staying overnight)" []
comment: Broadened from treatment to healthcare services generally.  "Low intensity" is not defined at the moment, but is needed to differentiate from same-day surgery centers or observation stays in hospitals that last <24 hours.  The idea is that few invasive procedures are performed, and the ones that are invasive are not typically much worse than a blood draw.  Maybe bone marrow biopsy is as aggressive as it gets.  I wonder if hematologists do that on an outpatient basis.

def: "An information content entity that is intended to be a truthful statement about some person and whether that person identifies as some particular aspect of social identity—such as a gender, an ethnicity, a race, or a sexual orientation—where the sense of identifying may correspond to either (i) an aspect of one’s cognitive representation of oneself, (ii) how one prefers to be regarded by others within some social context, or (iii) how one chooses to present oneself to others within some social context." []
comment: We include (i)-(iii) to acknowledge that there are different senses of "identify" that are relevant here, and that we may not always be sure which sense the person concretizing the social identity information content entity intended. While (i) concerns how one thinks of oneself, (ii) and (iii) are more focused on one's interactions with others. Importantly, some choose not to share with others how they identify in the sense of (i). For example, one can consider oneself to be some certain gender without either wanting others to know or choosing to present oneself in a corresponding way. We distinguish (ii) and (iii) because one can prefer to be regarded some certain way without attempting to present oneself in any corresponding way.

def: "A data set whose members are the specified output of some process of adjudicating health care insurance claims (and whose inputs are at least partly some members of a health care billing data set)." []
comment: It covers prescription claims because pharmacies bill insurance companies for patients’ prescriptions via submitting insurance claims.
comment: The insurance claim is submitted to the insurance company by either the patient or the provider. It is not necessarily always the provider, although in the United States, it typically is.
comment: The outcome of the adjudication of a claim in the claims dataset could be favorable or unfavorable for the healthcare provider, the patient, or both. The idea is just that they’ve been adjudicated, one way or the other (or anything in between if that’s a possibility).
comment: The reason we say billing data are only part of the input is because we are not conflating the insurance claim with the bill. It is our understanding that the provider’s bill of services is either part of the claim or “attached” to it in some manner, but doesn’t constitute the entire claim itself.
comment: The sources of these data are held by insurers or other health plan providers.

[]
comment: An interesting question is whether there must be another participant who is the "educator".  Some might object that many people are "self taught".  A real case of being self taught is the first person who learned to play a stringed instrument, or to spin a ball on the top of a finger.  There was no previous information about that.  The ICEs acquired are via one's sensory systems (vision, proprioception, auditory, etc.).\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of those who are self-taught by reading books or watching videos, or acquiring some other form of ICEs concretized outside their brain, one argument might be that the author of those ICEs somehow "plays a role" in the education, although they cannot participate in the education process itself (If I read Aristotle, and through repeated application of the information I acquire through doing so, develop the ability to write better ontology definitions, surely Aristotle did not actively participate in my particular education process, although he did influence it in a very real way).

comment: vocational education program
comment: Vocational education programs are designed for learners to acquire the knowledge, skills and competencies specific to a particular occupation, trade, or class of occupations or trades. Such programs may have work-based components (e.g. apprenticeships, dual-system education programmes). Successful completion of such programs leads to labor market-relevant, vocational qualifications acknowledged as occupationally-oriented by the relevant national authorities and/or the labor market.

comment: A gender identity that is the output of a racial identification process that uses the PCORnet CDM race or terminology. PCORnet CDM claims to use the 2015 Edition Health Information Technology (Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition, but the crucial difference is that PCORnet CDM requires persons to identify with only one category whereas the other does not have a multiple gender option, which changes the meaning of the values in the value set.

def: "A racial identity information content entity that uses the PCORnet CDM terminology for race, where this terminology corresponds to the values for the \"race\" field of the Demographic Table." []
comment: The PCORnet CDM's values for the race field are based on the OMB racial classification, but differ in that the PCORnet CDM allows one to select only one value for race and includes "multiple race" as an option, while OMB lacks a 'multiple race' option and allows multiple options to be selected.

[]
comment: This definition corresponds to that used by OMB, which is PCORnet's source for the terminology used for the value options of the 'race' field. It is worth noting that the OMB definition from which this one is derived is problematic, in that it implies that one's race cannot be Native American or Alaskan Native unless one maintains tribal affiliations or community attachment.

comment: The labels and definitions used for the subclasses of 'PCORnet sexual orientation identity information content entity' are based on the terminology used for the value set options for the PCORnet Common Data Model's 'sexual orientation' field, which is a modifed version of the terms for, and categories of, sexual orientation that are found in the "2015 Edition Health Information Technology (Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition, and ONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications" of the US Department of Health and Human Services (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/10/16/2015-25597/2015-edition-health-information-technology-health-it-certification-criteria-2015-edition-base). Neither the PCORnet CDM nor the other source provide definitions of their terms for sexual orientations. Our definitions for the corresponding classes thus point to the terms, rather than explain what they mean, as it is unclear how PCORnet intends them to be understood. Furthermore, these terms may be understood differently by different patients who select them as self-descriptions, as some may understand them to be defined in terms of phenotypic sex, others in terms of gender, and others in terms of some combination of the two.

comment: While this is not about one's identifying as having or not having some sexual orientation, we regard it as a 'sexual orientation identity information content entity,' which is defined as being about "whether one identifies as having some sexual orientation." For example, if one is uncertain whether one is bisexual or heterosexual, one might be in a state of questioning one's sexuality, and an information content entity about that would seem to qualify as being about whether one identifies as having some sexual orientations. Indeed, there would be two sexual orientations in that example, and the information content entity could be both about whether one identifies as bisexual and about whether one identifies as heterosexual.

def: "A PCORnet sexual orientation identity information content entity that is about some person's identifying as some sexual orientation that is not represented by the other value set options for the \"sexual orientation\" field of the PCORnet Demographic Table." []
comment: The labels and definitions used for the subclasses of 'PCORnet sexual orientation identity information content entity' are based on the terminology used for the value set options for the PCORnet Common Data Model's 'sexual orientation' field, which is a modifed version of the terms for, and categories of, sexual orientation that are found in the "2015 Edition Health Information Technology (Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition, and ONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications" of the US Department of Health and Human Services (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/10/16/2015-25597/2015-edition-health-information-technology-health-it-certification-criteria-2015-edition-base). Neither the PCORnet CDM nor the other source provide definitions of their terms for sexual orientations. Our definitions for the corresponding classes thus point to the terms, rather than explain what they mean, as it is unclear how PCORnet intends them to be understood. Furthermore, these terms may be understood differently by different patients who select them as self-descriptions, as some may understand them to be defined in terms of phenotypic sex, others in terms of gender, and others in terms of some combination of the two.

property_value: UBPROP:0000008 "We restrict this to the vertebrate specific structure - see the grouping class 'food storage organ' for analogous structures in other species. Teleosts: Zebrafish is functionally stomach-less, but may retain ontogenic footprint. Although the precise shape and size of the stomach varies widely among different vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the oesophagus opening directly into the intestine. The gastric lining is usually divided into two regions, an anterior portion lined by fundic glands, and a posterior with pyloric glands. Cardiac glands are unique to mammals, and even then are absent in a number of species. The distributions of these glands vary between species, and do not always correspond with the same regions as in man. Furthermore, in many non-human mammals, a portion of the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the oesophagus. Ruminants, in particular, have a complex stomach, the first three chambers of which are all lined with oesophageal mucosa" xsd:string

However, they develop in a very different way in most invertebrates than they do in vertebrates, and are not truly homologous. Many of the features found in human ovaries are common to all vertebrates, including the presence of follicular cells, tunica albuginea, and so on. However, many species produce a far greater number of eggs during their lifetime than do humans, so that, in fish and amphibians, there may be hundreds, or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary at any given time. In these species, fresh eggs may be developing from the germinal epithelium throughout life. Corpora lutea are found only in mammals, and in some elasmobranch fish; in other species, the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary. In birds, reptiles, and monotremes, the egg is relatively large, filling the follicle, and distorting the shape of the ovary at maturity. Amphibians and reptiles have no ovarian medulla; the central part of the ovary is a hollow, lymph-filled space. The ovary of teleosts is also often hollow, but in this case, the eggs are shed into the cavity, which opens into the oviduct. Although most normal female vertebrates have two ovaries, this is not the case in all species. In birds and platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional. In some elasmobranchs, the reverse is true, with only the right ovary fully developing. In the primitive jawless fish, and some teleosts, there is only one ovary, formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo" xsd:string

Marsupials have two uteruses, each of which connect to a lateral vagina and which both use a third, middle 'vagina' which functions as the birth canal. Marsupial embryos form a choriovitelline 'placenta' (which can be thought of as something between a monotreme egg and a 'true' placenta), in which the egg's yolk sac supplies a large part of the embryo's nutrition but also attaches to the uterine wall and takes nutrients from the mother's bloodstream." xsd:string

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
